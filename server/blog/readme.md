#Scotch
###A really classy, dead simple, markdown based, blogging framework for node.js
 ...
To try Scotch for yourself, make sure that you have node, npm, and mongodb installed (and running), then do this:

    $> npm install -g scotch-blog
    $> scotch create blog
    $> cd blog
    $> sudo scotch serve

Go to `http://0.0.0.0/dashboard/install` to install Scotch.

Your blog should be up and running on `http://localhost`

### Static Site Generation

    $> cd blog
    $> scotch generate
    
Your you should now have a 'static' directory in your blog's root directory.

Read the [deployment docs](#deployment) on how to configure static site deployment.

#### Deployment

Create `config/deployment.js` and fill it with your deployment settings then run `scotch deploy` from your terminal. At the moment we support S3 and FTP deployment, with gh-pages on its way.

##### Sample S3 Settings
```js
module.exports = {
  "destination": "s3"
, "opts": {
    "bucket": "<BUCKET NAME>"
  , "key": "<AWS ACCESS KEY>"
  , "secret": "<AWS SECRET KEY>"
  , "region": "<AWS REGION>"      //us-west-1
  }
};
```

##### Sample FTP Settings
```js
module.exports = {
  "destination": "ftp"
, "opts": {
    "host": "<FTP HOST>"          //ftp.myserver.com
  , "port": <FTP PORT>            //Default: 21
  , "username": "<FTP USERNAME>"
  , "password": "<FTP PASSWORD>"
  }
};
```

#### Plugins

Plugins are installed via npm and enabled via in `app/config/environment.js`.

```
/*
* Sample app/config/environment.js
* `npm install readmore`
*/
var config = {
  port: 80,
  model: {
    defaultAdapter: 'mongo'
  },
  db: {
    mongo: {
      dbname: 'blog'
    }
  },
  plugins: {
    formatters: [
      'readmore'
    ]
  }
};

module.exports = config;
```

##### Formatters

Formatter plugins enhance the markdown language.

```js
/*
* An example formatter plugin that replaces the string "charcount" with the number
* of characters in the markdown source when viewing a post in the blog index
*/
var replacer = function (buffer) {
  //`this` in the context of a formatter plugin refers to the post model
  return buffer.replace(/charcount/, this.markdown.length);
};

/*
* You can modify either the `index` or `show` actions.
* By not exporting to exports.show, our plugin will only
* run on posts during the index action
*/
exports.index = replacer;

```
