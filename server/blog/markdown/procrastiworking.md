What is the most important asset that will help you achieve your ultimate goal in life?

It is not money, neither is it time; it is **focus**.

> When what you do is aligned with your highest priorities, you will have less stress, and you will be able to claim inner peace.

### Paralysis By Analysis

More often than not, your top priorities, your values, your aspirations, and your objectives are **obscured** by competing demands on **your** *time* and *attention*. 

> How do you feel, when you have so much to do, and you don't know which one to start with? &ndash; Let me give you a hint: "**instant stress**". 

A moderate level of stress can be motivating, when not managed well, however, it can **paralyze** you instead. To overcome this **paralysis by analysis**, you will need to **selectively eliminate** things.

Let me tell you more about my story, to put things into perspective:

### It's Projects Everywhere!

Aside from my day-to-day job, I have a lot of side-projects to deal with. 
And when I "projects", I mean projects [in the GTD sense][gtd-project]. 

Here are just a select few of my mid-to-long-term projects:

* [Linkibol][linkibol]: A way to parse long stream of text including links;
* [o2.js][o2js]: A JavaScript framework in the middle of a rewrite;
* [JFDI][jfdi]: An efficient way to **get $#!% done**;
* [Rewriting all of my articles][rewrite];
* Optimizing this blog you're reading, for speed and performance;
* I have an ever-growing list of technical reading, podcasts to listen to, and videos to watch;
* This blog is also a ["work in progress" open source project][o2jscom] that I plan to convert into an easy to publish **static blogging application**;
* I have friends and colleagues who want my help on their awesomest startup idea, which is "*the next big thing*" according to them;
* I try to collaborate and add value to the developer community in various online groups, forums, and discussions;
* I will have to prepare to present at a couple of tech-talks, within the following few months;
* Last, but not the least, I have to finalize [my book][mybook], in less than a month.

> I'm sure if you are a reader of this article, your situation is similar (*if not worse*) to mine. &ndash; What I will be sharing here is not rocket science; it's common sense; and it helped me **regain** my **inner peace**, so can it help you too.

And this is just tip of the iceberg, I can add more items to the above this list&hellip; like&hellip; forever. These are a fraction of my personal development **liabilities**. And my assets (*i.e. my available free time*) are **scarce**, to say the least.

### Jedi Mind Tricks

You know what? We are extremely skillful in deceiving ourselves: 

It is incredibly easy to keep yourself "*busy*" with unimportant things that are **not** aligned with your goals.

> Doing actual work is hard; and it will take a very long time for you to see your efforts pay off. Whereas doing things that disguise themselves as work gives instant satisfaction. 

It's exceptionally relieving to **re-re-re-organize** your ever-growing to-do list. And, of course, you will feel extremely satisfied when you reach to "**[inbox zero][inboxZero]**" after sifting all of your e-mails for three hours. 

The problem with that is; all of those micro-management tasks give you a **false** sense of achievement. More often than not, it's your mind creating an illusion of achievement, so that it can avoid doing actual stuff as long as possible.

>It's like eating Halloween candies: They are delicious, they give you a sense of satisfaction, and they are of zero use to you. Besides, they may even be harmful on the long run **;)**.

### When In Doubt, Do It Tomorrow

Being to father of a 16 month old, attention seeking cute little daughter; I find myself lucky if I can spare **one hour of uninterrupted time** per day. 

> [Pomodoro][pomodoro]? Forget about it! 
> If you have kids, you will be distracted at least eight times during a single pomodoro!

So I constantly have a *too little time* versus *too much things to do* dilemma, which from time to time creates additional **stress**.

So is there a solution out of this feeling of weight on your shoulders?<br>
Yes, there is. 

Is it easy, and applicable?<br> 
**Absolutely**!

And before diving into that, let's see what "time management" **isn't**:

### "*Time Management*" is a Luxury for Those Who Have Time

For the last ten years, I've read a lot of productivity books and articles, and I've tried techniques like [GTD][gtd], [pomodoro][pomodoro], ["don't break the chain" technique][chain],  and [the action method][action]. I even have developed [my own methodology of getting stuff done][jfdi-system]. 

I have tried hundreds of productivity software, as well. I'm not just testing the waters; I've fallen from the productivity bandwagon, and put myself back on track over and over again.

And here is what I've found:

> **You cannot manage time**; you can only prevent time from managing you.

Contrary to popular belief, **time management** is **not** getting lots of stuff done as quickly as possible. What is more important, in deed, is making sure that you are working on the **right things**. 

> Given **time management is an illusion** to make you feel that you are in control; the only way to get important stuff done is to **procrastiwork**.

Procrasti&hellip; what?!

### Procrastiworking

> **Procrastiworking** (n): Delaying stuff to **tomorrow**, to do more stuff **today**.

I'm an engineer. So my job involves analyzing requirements, balancing resources, evaluating **trade-off**s and **sacrificing** to meet **constraints**.

I apply the same approach to my personal projects, too. Namely, I work on the things that will make a big impact, and delay the rest to tomorrow.

One way to do this is to pick the most important things that will give the greatest outcome, in the shortest amount of time, and only work on them.

> If you feel like you are doing the right thing; you are.

And it's not only me who thinks like that. Here's what [Jeff Attwood has to say][todont] on the subject matter:

>  If you can't wake up every day and, using your 100% original equipment God-given organic brain, come up with the three most important things you need to do that day &ndash; then you should seriously work on fixing that. I don't mean install another app, or read more productivity blogs and books. You have to figure out what's important to you and what motivates you; ask yourself why that stuff isn't gnawing at you enough to make you get it done. Fix that.

### Pick Your Top Three

Here are my top three things on my plate, right now:

* Finishing [my book on **JavaScript Interview Questions**][book],
* Working on [**JFDI**][jfdi],
* And **writing** a blog post *every other week* [to complete this list][blogs].

> I don't know why, and I've found out that **there is some magic in the number three**: Focusing on less feels like you are losing control; and having more than three things to consider at a time feels like an **overburden**.

Here's why these things are the "**top three**" in my list:

* [JFDI][jfdi] is aligned with my **procrastiworking** methodology, so developing it will also formalize my system of productivity; and since it's a command-line application written in **Node.JS**, it's really fun to develop.
* **Writing** (*be it a book, or a blog post*) is always an **educational adventure**: To write good content, you will have to read stuff, watch videos; **consume more content**. So it is be hitting multiple birds with one stone.

More importantly, I can slice either of these goals into one-hour time slots. For instance, I can draft an article for an hour, and then continue from where I left, the next day.

I can even draft blog post, during my daily train commutes (**which I am doing right now, as I am typing these lines in my [markdown editor][markdown-editor])

### Doesn't This Make [JFDI][jfdi] Redundant?

Not necessarily. 

It all depends on how you use the system: 

> **JFDI** program uses two lists (the **today** queue, and the **tomorrow** queue) to manage your goals. And you can easily defer a goal in your **today** queue, to **tomorrow**. [You can read the project' README file][jfdi-readme], for more information on how this works.

During the course of the day, you will have a lot of small errands (like "make sure you talk to Sarah", "read this article tonight", "send an e-mail to the book's editors before noon", "remember the milk"&hellip; &ndash; none of these goals would be "*rocket surgery*" per se). 

And that's where **JFDI** comes into play: Keeping a queue for **today**'s goals, and deferring stuff that do not need to be done today, to **tomorrow** is a really simple, yet elegant idea:

> If an item on my **today** queue bothers me, I immediately defer it; and don't think about it until I find some time to reflect upon my **tomorrow** queue.
