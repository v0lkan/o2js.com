o2js.com v2 - A New Hope

> By the end of this month (*Aug 30, 2013*) I will be shutting down the old o2.js blog, and **rewriting** 
> the articles one by one to this blog. I have several reasons for that:<br>
> <br>
> 1. I want to re-organize the articles into more meaningful categories;<br>
> 2. Since the technology evolves faster than my writing speed, some of these articles need
> serious editing and rewriting.<br>
> 3. [While writing my book][jsiq] I've learned a
> lot about how to present information – knowing something, and expressing your knowledge to a broader audience are two different things. So an overall editing process
> would be useful.<br>

And I thought the best way to make it happen is<br> 
**[to start with a blank slate][tabula-rasa]** **;)**.

Since I have backups of the former blog's database, I haven't lost anything.

> I will also be shooting multiple birds with one stone, since one of my goals is [to convert all my blog posts to markdown][markdown].

<h3 id="topic-list">Topic List</h3>

Here are the topics and article that will be carried over in time. 
I also will be writing new articles too, so it will take a while to copy, transfer, and refine everything.

> I will be updating this post as a **canonical linked list** to all my blog posts; so if you are looking for something, it's highly probably that it will be linked here.

That's all for now **;)**.

Strating with the next month, I will try to write a new blog post **every two weeks**. So it will be like a never-ending [blog sprint][scrum] for me **:)**.

We'll see how it goes.
